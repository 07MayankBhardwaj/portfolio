     <h3 class="page-title">War Flight Reconnaissance: Aerial Wardriving Project</h3>

    <div class="posts"><div class="post">
      <div class="post-content">

   <p>This project presents a detailed description of a war flight reconnaissance project that utilized wardriving techniques. The project involved the deployment of an ESP8266 + R1 mini hardware peripherals strapped to a Mavic Pro quadcopter, along with a NEO 6m GPS module and an SD Logger mini for ESP8266. Additionally, an Arduino UNO was used to capture data separately. The primary objective was to collect wardriving data during an aerial reconnaissance test conducted in the vicinity of UPES Bidholi, where our university is located. This report outlines the steps involved in the project, highlights the hardware components and software used, and provides insights into the data capture and analysis process.</p>
   <p>T3.1 Hardware Integration: The ESP8266 + R1 mini and associated peripherals were securely mounted onto the Mavic Pro quadcopter, ensuring stability and minimizing interference with the drone's flight dynamics. The NEO 6m GPS module was connected to the ESP8266 to provide accurate positioning information. The SD Logger mini was interfaced with the ESP8266 to record the wardriving data. Additionally, an Arduino UNO was utilized to capture data separately, enhancing the overall data collection process.

    <p>3.2 Software Implementation: The software implementation involved programming the ESP8266 using Arduino IDE. Custom code was developed to enable the ESP8266 to scan for nearby Wi-Fi networks and record their details, including SSID, signal strength, encryption type, and channel information. The Arduino UNO was programmed to capture wardriving data independently using suitable libraries and interfaces.</p>
    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p><li>1. Import the CSV file: Begin by importing the CSV file generated from the ESP8266 wardriving rig. This file contains the captured wardriving data, including information about the detected Wi-Fi networks. The specific method of importing the CSV file may vary depending on the programming environment or tool you are using.

      <li>2. Format and structure of the CSV file: Ensure that the CSV file follows the CSV convention and has the necessary columns containing relevant information such as the SSID (network name), signal strength, encryption type, channel information, and timestamp. This information will be crucial for analyzing the wardriving data.
      
      <li>3. Filtering duplicate networks: Since you mentioned that there were duplicate networks detected when the drone was sitting idle during takeoff or landing, it is important to filter out those duplicates to obtain accurate results. One way to accomplish this is by applying a time filter. By setting a specific time range, you can exclude networks captured during idle periods and focus only on the networks detected during the actual flight.
      
      <li>4. Applying the time filter: Identify the column in your CSV file that contains the timestamp for each captured network. This timestamp represents the exact time when each network was detected. Determine the time corresponding to the takeoff point of your drone (referred to as 'takeoff_timestamp' in the example code) and filter the data by selecting only the networks that have timestamps later than the takeoff time. This will remove the duplicate networks detected during idle periods and retain the networks captured during the flight.
      
      <li>5. Counting unique networks: Once you have the filtered data, you can calculate the number of unique networks detected during the flight. This can be done by counting the distinct SSID values in the filtered dataset. Each unique SSID represents a unique network.
      
      <li>6. Flight duration: To determine the flight time, you can calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum timestamps in the filtered dataset. This will provide an estimation of the duration of the flight during which the wardriving data was captured.</p>
